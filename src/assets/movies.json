    "description": "Google's AI AlphaZero has shocked the chess world. Leaning on its deep neural networks, and general reinforcement learning algorithm, DeepMind's AI Alpha Zero learned to play chess well beyond the skill level of master, besting the 2016 top chess engine Stockfish 8 in a 100-game match. Alpha Zero had 28 wins, 72 draws, and 0 losses. Impressive right? And it took just 4 hours of self-play to reach such a proficiency. What the chess world has witnessed from this historic event is, simply put, mind-blowing! AlphaZero vs Magnus Carlsen anyone? :)",

Maybe you already saved some data using Local Storage, fetched user coordinates using Geolocation, or even drew graphs and other objects using Canvas. But did you know there are many more new JavaScript APIs in the Web Platform? In this talk, we’ll see how to leverage the power of those APIs in order to create better experiences for your users.",

    "description": "SVGs, with their potential for high-quality and performant graphics, have myriad uses on the web. By now, a lot of developers are aware of their practical uses, such as small and accessible icons, or illustrations. In this session, though, Sarah will go beyond typical use cases. She’ll cover a few practical things like styling SVG icons like typography, and then dive into the creative wilds of this graphic format built with math. She’ll make it respond to physics, make it bounce and snap, stack it like legos for responsive, and make it interactive with front-end frameworks like Vue.js and React. In this session Sarah will push the boundaries of what’s possible while also thinking about cross-browser stability, and you’ll come out of it with a whole new world of tools in your front-end developer toolbox.",
